TO DO:
Test this configuration for AI playing 'O' with heuristic = -20 * enemy_4s -40 * my_3s
When depth is 8, it plays 34, thus stopping me from putting four in a row.
When depth is 10, it plays 41 because technically all moves are valued as -20 besides 12 which is valued -40
  1 2 3 4 5
1 O - O - -
2 - - - - -
3 - X X - X
4 - - - - -
5 - - - - -
Maybe this situtation is completely doomed in 10 moves and it doesn't matter what he plays?
